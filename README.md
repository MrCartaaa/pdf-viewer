# PDF-Viewer
A **Pure Python PDFViewer**, which provides functionalities same as other famous PDFViewers. Following are the some of main features of this application

- Searching through text
- Table of contents
- Take notes and save them automatically
- Developed in pure python

## Why bother creating new PDF Viewer?
 I wanted to create an application that requires me to have a PDF Viewer with access to the source code in python. I searched the internet for a PDF Viewer written in Python, but all in vain. I couldn't find any reasonable result.
Hence, I decided to create my own PDF Viewer, that uses pure python packages.

## How to run?
Make sure you have installed these packages:

- PySimpleGUI
- PyMuPDF
- fitz

You can simple run this command to install all packages. First make sure you are in same directory as *requirements.txt*, then type:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the packages, then you have to simple run this command:

`python pdfviewer.py`

Given command will generate this screen:

Now, you can open any book and enjoy reading.

## Language
I have used "Urdu" language for my application, but don't worry I will be converting the viewer into English and will add some more features also. 

## TODO
Following are some of the tasks that I am working on currently.

- Use English throughout the application
- Add zooming capability
- Add DocStrings and comments in the code
- Fix bugs in searching feature

## Special Thanks
I want to thanks [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) for developing such a great GUI-Framework in python.
